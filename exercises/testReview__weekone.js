// What is the significance of JavaScript in modern web development,
/* JavaScript in modern development is significant 
   because it allows users to interact with the webpage. 
   Its a dynamic programming language.
   Client-side web Development!*/

//List and explain all JavaScript primitive data types, including their typical use cases.
/*  String = textual data > display info on the client side / store data (names and emails in backend)
    Number = numerical data > use values to do calculations
    BigiNT = large integers > it can ONLY be used with other bigInt values
    Boolean = true or false stataments > set logical conditions, user or coder accessibility 
    Null = intentional absence of value > letting user leave user inputs as empty
    Undefined = uninitialized variable or non-intential absence of value
    Symbol = unique and immutable property keys

//Describe how 'undefined' is different from 'null' in JavaScript, with examples of when each might be encountered
/*  A Undefined data type means it is declared but there is a absence of a value. 
    If a input field requires an input, 
    a undefined value would let the JavaScript engine know that the field is required
    then let the user know. 

    A null data type is an intentional absence of a value. 
    If a user input isn't filled, this data type doesn't result in an error on the console.

/*  Let greeting = "Hello, how are you?";
    Console.log(greeting);

//What are the two types of comments in JavaScript, and how do they impact code readability and execution?
/* The double slash and the slash and star

//What is the result of '10' - '5' + 5 in JavaScript, and why?
